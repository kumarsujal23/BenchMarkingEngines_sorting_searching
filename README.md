# BenchMarkingEngines_sorting_searching
C++ Sorting and Serching Algorithm Benchmarking Engine
Built a C++ benchmarking engine comparing sorting (Bubble, Quick, Merge) and searching (Linear, Binary) algorithms across large datasets 
Demonstrated OOP (abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism) via virtual methods and selective friend class access for performance analysis and Visualized time and operation complexity (O(nÂ²), O(n log n), O(log n)) using manual counters and chrono for benchmarking
